Thrilled to announce the launch of **Flight Route Optimization Live**, my latest project!

This dynamic web application uses **Java, Graph, and Heap** on the backend to power optimal flight route calculations via **Dijkstra's algorithm**. On the frontend, I brought it to life with **JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and HTML**, creating interactive maps that visualize routes and display key travel metrics. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience blending complex algorithms with a user-friendly interface.
